Business Understanding
Problem Statement:
 Fraudulent activity within digital payments causes financial losses, reputational risk, and operational strain.
Goal:
 Build a reliable, fast, and interpretable model to assess a user‚Äôs likelihood of committing fraud ‚Äî enabling Lydia‚Äôs systems and analysts to act quickly and accurately.
Business Benefits:
Reduce manual fraud reviews
Prioritize high-risk users in real time
Improve overall fraud detection precision and reduce false positives
Speed up API response time for internal teams

Data and Feautes
Data Sources: Historical user and transaction data across Lydia‚Äôs systems 
Feature Categories:
User information: age, account age, KYC status, email, phone details
User actions: password resets, device changes, alias modifications
Transactions: volume, amounts, success/failure rates over 24h‚Äì90d
Patterns: time between transactions, use of ATM or betting MCCs
Beneficiaries: number, foreign IBANs, neo-bank usage
üëâ ~500 engineered features built via SQL in the Feature Library and stored in ‚Äúfeature_event‚Äù tables for high performance.

Data Preperation & Model Training
Approach: Supervised machine learning (classification)
 Algorithm: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
 Training Process:
6 months of historical data
Balanced dataset: ~10% fraudsters, 90% normal users
Features labeled using fraud analysts‚Äô case reviews
Train/test split (70/30) to measure performance
 Preprocessing: Handled class imbalance, feature scaling, encoding

Model Results and Evaluation
Metric Focus: Precision Recall and False Positive Rate 
(details in other page)
Interpretation (non-technical):
The model detects significantly more fraud cases while reducing false alarms ‚Äî meaning fewer legitimate users wrongly flagged.

Key Findings (for Business leaders)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Fraud detection is now faster and more accurate.
Real-time scoring enables immediate escalation or auto-blocking
2Ô∏è‚É£ Automation reduces analyst workload.
Fraud team can focus on complex cases instead of bulk reviews.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Shared feature library adds scalability.
One definition of each feature across the organization ‚Üí less code duplication and easier model reuse.

Actionable Insights
For Fraud Operations:
Use fraud score thresholds to trigger automatic freezes or reviews.
Integrate model results with Slack alerts for team prioritization.
For Product & Tech:
Continue parallelization and cache optimization.
Periodically retrain the model (6‚Äì12 months) using recent behavior data.

Next Steps
For Fraud Operations:
Use fraud score thresholds to trigger automatic freezes or reviews.
Integrate model results with Slack alerts for team prioritization.
For Product & Tech:
Continue parallelization and cache optimization.
Periodically retrain the model (6‚Äì12 months) using recent behavior data.

Conclusion
Summary:
 The new Fraud Score model and API redesign deliver faster fraud detection, better accuracy, and scalable infrastructure.
Business Value:
 Lydia can identify and block fraudulent activity earlier ‚Äî protecting users and reducing losses ‚Äî while improving efficiency across teams.
